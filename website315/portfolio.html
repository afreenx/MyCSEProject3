       <li><a href="https://github.com/afreenx/TechnicalProjects/tree/main/GeneratePrimes/H7" target="_blank">
        Hexagon Cross Primes Java Generator</a></li>
        
        <p id="techFormat">
        <br>This project was created for CSCE 314 and is a project where I had to build a user interface in Java
        that generates hexagon cross primes. The user enters the number of hexagon primes they would wish to see and the program
        will output it in a list. Some of the difficulties faced during this project was the data generating into the 
        GUI itself. Data generation was super slow for number enteries above 100 and often the GUI would crash. Without
        the GUI this program can generate up to 1000 hexagon primes into a file called results.txt. I had to learn
        how to use JavaFX and screenbuilder for this project and it really helped further my knowledge of Java. I have
        the development of the project and the classes and methods documented as well.

       <li><a href="https://github.com/afreenx/TechnicalProjects/tree/main/HackCPU" target="_blank">
        Hack CPU</a></li>

        <p id="techFormat">
            <br>The Hack CPU is a simple computer that can run Hack programs. This is a project I made for CSCE 312. 
            This project focuses on the usage of HDL unlike the first project which was in Java, and is based on chips.
            The chips created for this was a memory chip, a computer chip, and a cpu chip which effectively created a 
            program that can run Hack machine language using a Hardware Simulator. This project was based off of a 
            <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/project05">Nand2Tetris project</a> and the textbook from that site was
            used for my computer architecture class (CSCE 312).

       <li><a href="https://github.com/afreenx/TechnicalProjects/tree/main/AssemDissem" target="_blank">
        Hack Assembler/Disassembler</a></li>

        <p id="techFormat">
            <br> This is the project I did for CSCE 312 creating a Hack Assembler and Disassembler. I used 
            C++ to complete this task. The assembler reads in an assembly file (.asm) and then creates a Hack file 
            (.hack) which is the machine langauge. The Disassembler does the opposite and the user is prompted to enter
            the (.hack) file first. This project was one of my favorite assigned projects because it felt like
            I really was able to create something on my own that could switch the format of the files. Earlier in this
            class the Assembler.bat from the Nand2Tetris site programs was used to do this. Although, one fault with 
            this is that it's hard to convert variables into machine code and tracking them was very difficult so 
            that was not done in my Disassembler.

            I would like to continue to work on more projects that can develop my programming skills further. 
            I have not created a project yet that doesn't have a set of instructions to it. I would love to be able
            to create without much guidelines in the future when my programming skills get better.
