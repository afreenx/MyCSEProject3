    <p id = "serviceP"> I have volunteered at <a href="https://humanetomorrow.org/" target="_blank">
        Humane Tomorrow</a> which is an animal protection organization close to where I live. 
        I have also done a project on them in high school and went out to go see renovation sites
        alongside meeting therapy dogs. They focus on healing and finding new homes
        for abused pets and a part of volunteering was also spreading awareness and fundraising. 
    
    <br><br> I would like to give back to this world by becoming someone reliable and generating enough
    wealth to be able to make a big impact on charities. I still make an effort to donate clothing and 
    give money to charity organizations when I have the chance to. Even those people that come door to door
    trying to sell stuff I tend to always feel bad and buy as a form of donation. I have never really
    worked yet, and once I do start earning a lot more money I want to be able to give back. 
    In the religion I follow it is mandatory to give Zakat which is 2.5% of my assets and future salary to
    charities every year and I would like to earn a LOT so I can give more.
