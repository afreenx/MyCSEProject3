  <p id="qualificationP">I am driven by a curiosity to explore new areas within the field of Computer Science. Currently, my interests lie in <a target="_blank" href="https://hevodata.com/learn/database-systems/#:~:text=Database%20Systems%20or%20DBMS%20is,to%20store%20and%20retrieve%20data">database systems</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML">machine learning</a>. Working on networks and databases particularly captivates me due to their widespread usage and daily impact. Furthermore, I believe it is vital to possess a deep understanding of the products we sell, such as cloud services or software solutions, in order to effectively meet customer needs. With machine learning, I see the potential for AI to assist software developers and automate tasks, thereby creating a comprehensive database of usable software with versatile applications.</p>

<p>In addition to technical expertise, effective communication with fellow programmers is crucial. Learning how to program has provided me with valuable insights into code development and improved my ability to communicate with precision. Currently, I have a solid foundation in Java, C++, Python, and Scheme programming languages. I approach learning with determination, always striving to understand complex issues thoroughly. I adapt easily to new situations and maintain a positive attitude, which enables me to tackle challenges head-on.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I possess proficiency in Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, as well as a basic understanding of AutoCAD and 3D printing technologies.</p>
