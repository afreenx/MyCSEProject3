   <p id="qualificationP">I'm open to exploring new areas of Computer Science and my interests currently are on 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://hevodata.com/learn/database-systems/#:~:text=Database%20Systems%20or%20DBMS%20is,to%20store%20and%20retrieve%20data">database systems</a>
    and

    I am interested in working on networks and databases because they are widespread and used daily.
    I also think it is important to know your product before attempting to sell it as well. I feel this way with
    cloud services or any software service a deep understanding of how it already works is crucial
    for success before selling it to customers. Machine learning is also an interest of mine because some AI is already helping software developers, and 
    I think that automation of tasks and creating a database of useable software that can be applied anywhere will be
    super useful. It's also important to be able to effectively communicate with programmers, and learning how to
    program has helped me understand writing code a bit better. <br><br>
    So far, I would say I have basic skills in Java, C++, Python, and Scheme. I am also stubborn when it comes to 
    learning new things and I make sure to do my best to understand every issue. I always strive to gain a deeper
    understanding on topics and I adapt to situations easily and keep a positive attitude. 
    I am also proficient in Microsoft Excel, Word, and Power Point. I know basic AutoCAD and 3D printing.
