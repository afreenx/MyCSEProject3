    <div class="middleparagraph"> Hello, my name is Afreen Fatima and I am currently studying
        at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M University.</a>
        <p>I have a deep passion for exploration and travel, always seeking new experiences and adventures. My ultimate goal is to find a profession that allows me to embrace this lifestyle fully.</p>

        <p>Originally from Texas, I have spent a significant portion of my life here, from middle school to the present day. However, I have also lived in Troy, Michigan, and Seattle, Washington, which has given me diverse perspectives and shaped my worldview.</p>

        <p>From an early age, computers have had a profound impact on me. With constant access to a laptop, thanks to my father's career in esteemed tech companies like Oracle, IBM, and Amazon, I have been immersed in the world of technology. As I grow older, my interest in Computer Science has blossomed, and I find myself increasingly drawn to coding. The challenges it presents fuel my enthusiasm, and I eagerly embrace the opportunity to acquire new skills and enhance my problem-solving abilities.</p>

        <p>This website serves as a platform to showcase my qualifications, services, and portfolio, providing a comprehensive overview of my capabilities. Join me on this journey as I combine my love for exploration with my passion for Computer Science.</p>
