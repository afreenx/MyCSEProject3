    <div class="middleparagraph"> Hello, my name is Afreen Fatima and I am currently a junior studying
        at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University.</a>  I am majoring in Industrial
    Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I have always enjoyed going out 
    and experiencing things while traveling. A profession in the future that allows me to continue to live this 
    lifestyle is my end goal. 
    <br> <br>I'm from Flower Mound, Texas and have been here for a good chunk of my life (middle school-current). 
    I previously lived in Troy, Michigan and Seattle, Washington. I was born in Bangalore, India. 
    <br> <br>I think that I've always been very influenced by computers pretty much since I was young
    I've always had access to a laptop and I don't remember ever not having one since my dad has
    been working for various tech companies (Oracle, IBM, Amazon) for the past 20 years. I started
    with my love-hate relationship for coding when I learned my first language which was Java back 
    in 9th grade and then I completely quit until freshman year of college and I tried ENGR 102 
    (Beginner Python Class) out. That class really felt easy and gave me hope that I can continue
    pursuing Computer Science. I think now that I'm a bit older I enjoy coding more than previously
    where I used to get really upset when things didn't work out. Now, I enjoy the challenge it brings 
    and I look forward to learning new skills and really working on my problem-solving. 
  

    <p>This website is centered around me and shows my qualifications, service, and my portfolio.
